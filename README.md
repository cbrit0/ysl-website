# ysl-website

Welcome to the YSL Beauty Webpage Replica project! This is a personal project aimed at replicating the official [YSL Beauty website](https://www.yslbeauty.com/) using modern web development technologies. The project is currently under construction and is only accessible on localhost. It is not intended for commercial use but rather as a showcase of my frontend development skills.

## Technologies Used

- **React + Vite**: For building the user interface and managing components.
- **TailwindCSS**: For styling the components and ensuring a responsive design.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: For creating smooth and complex animations.
- **Three.js**: For integrating 3D models into the webpage.
- **Splide.js**: For creating interactive and responsive carousels.

## Project Status

This project is currently **under construction**. The webpage is only visible on localhost and is not yet deployed to any live server. The primary goal is to replicate the YSL Beauty website as closely as possible, focusing on the frontend design and user experience.

**Note**: The application is **not yet responsive** to smaller and medium devices. This is a feature that will be implemented in future updates.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

## Usage

This project is purely for **entertainment and educational purposes**. It is not intended to be used for any commercial activities or to earn money. The main objective is to demonstrate my skills as a frontend developer and to explore the capabilities of modern web technologies.

## Responsiveness

As of now, the application is **not responsive** to smaller and medium devices. This is a known limitation, and I am actively working on implementing responsive design to ensure the webpage looks great on all screen sizes.
